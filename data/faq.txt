What is Post?
Post specializes in selling aesthetic, and-sometimes-uncommon postcards.
How do I customize a postcard?
At this time, postcards are not customizable.
Where are the locations of the postcards?
We have cards from all around the world: North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Weâ€™re always looking to add new cards to our store!
Are there shipping fees?
Not for customers in the U.S. Unfortunately, shipping fees may apply for international buyers.
I have an additional question!
