**Author:** Jay Siri
**Last Updated:** 10/19/22

The Post API provides functionality to retrieve and post data for my postcard store.

Clients can retrieve information for current items available on store, such as categories, products, and images. Functionality is also provided to send "contact us" messages.

Summary of endpoints:
* GET /promos
* GET /faqs
* GET /postcards
* GET /postcards/:continent
* GET /descriptions/:locations
* POST /contact
...

In the current version of this API, all error responses are returned as plain text. Any 500 errors represent a server-side issue and include a generic error message. Any 400-level errors represent an invalid request by a client, and are documented appropriately for any parameterized endpoint.
